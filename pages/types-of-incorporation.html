          <h4>Why to Register a Holding Company</h4>
          <p>
          Multinational companies may decide to establish a holding company for a range of reasons. For example, a
          holding company may be an efficient vehicle to own shares of other companies to form a corporate group, to
          allow the reduction of risk for the owners and thus allow the ownership and control of a number of different
          companies or, amongst others, to provide tax efficiency in relation to withholding taxes on dividends and taxes on
          capital gains.</p><br>

          <h4>Advantages and Disadvantages of
          Holding and Subsidiary Companies</h4>
          
          <p>Advantages</p>
          <p>There are certain advantages to acquiring a controlling interest in a subsidiary as a holding company.
          The most important ones include:
          The capability of controlling operations with a small percentage of ownership, thus lesser up-front investment;
          Holding companies can take risks through subsidiaries, thus limiting this risk only to subsidiaries instead of
          placing the parent company on the line;
          Expansion can occur through the way of simple stock purchase in public market, which shuns the difficult step of
          obtaining approval from the subsidiary’s board of directors;</p>
          
          <p>Disadvantages</p>
          However, there are also some disadvantages associated with holding companies model. These include:
          If less than 80% or 90% of the stock is owned by the parent company, the holding company can eventually pay
          more taxes, depending on its company of registration’s rules.<br/><br/>
          A holding company can be required to dissolve more easily as contrasted to a single merger operation.
          Moreover, there are possibilities of a holding company to expand through the use of debt or leverage, building an
          intricate corporate structure which can include unrealized values, thus creating a risk if interest rates on
          obligations or the evaluation of assets posted as guarantee for loans alter radically.<br/><br/>
          
          <p>Finding the Right Location for a Holding Company</p>
          Choosing the appropriate location for a holding company is a complex procedure—involving consideration of
          business, economic, logistical and operational requirements.
          Choosing the right jurisdiction for a holding company, you need to consider (a) taxation of incoming dividends; (b)
          corporate income tax on received dividends; and (c) taxation of ongoing dividends.<br/><br/>
          
          Incoming dividends from a subsidiary company must be either exempted from withholding tax or be subject to a
          reduced tax rate (i.e. 5%-10%); this can be achieved by having a DTA (Double Taxation Agreement) in place – a
          convention for avoidance of double taxation, between the state of the parent company and that where the
          subsidiary is located.<br/><br/>
          If the parent and subsidiary companies are located in the EU member states no withholding tax is levied on such
          dividends from the subsidiary according to the EU parent/subsidiary directive. This rule applies where the parent
          company holds more than 10% of stake in its subsidiary.<br/><br/>
          On the other hand, it is vital that the holding jurisdiction, where the funds will be received as dividends, be
          exempted from corporate tax or reduced through tax credit method.<br/><br/>
          The Netherlands, as an example, apply the “participation exemption rules”, to exempt incoming funds from the
          subsidiary, from taxation on the parent company level. Nevertheless, this “participation exemption rules” apply if
          the following conditions are met: the Dutch holding must own at least 5% of shares of its subsidiary, such shares
          must be held from the beginning of fiscal year, the subsidiary profit must be taxed, the parent company must be
          actively involved in the business of its subsidiary, and the subsidiary must not be a ‘tax exempt portfolio
          investment company’.<br/><br/>
          If the beneficiary is domiciled in different jurisdiction than the holding jurisdiction it is of the essence that the
          ongoing dividends are subject to low tax rate. As it has been seen above under the EU parent/subsidiary directive
          no taxes will be levied in the dividends flow within the EU jurisdictions. Another option is to choose a jurisdiction
          with an extensive network of DTAs or even a jurisdiction where taxes are paid only once and on the company
          level, i.e. no withholding taxes are levied on the outgoing dividends.
          
          <p>Advantages of a Subsidiary Company</p>
          The holding company provides the subsidiary company with buying power, research and development funds,
          marketing money and know-how, employees, technical expertise and other features which otherwise it could not
          afford or accomplish alone.
          The parent can provide the monetary means and capability to jump start new companies and products.
          Ability to offset profits and losses of one part of a business with another;
          Liabilities and credit claims are locked in that subsidiary and cannot be passed on to the parent company;
          Allows for joint ventures with other companies, with each one owning a portion of the new business operation;<br/><br/>
          
          Disadvantages of a Subsidiary Company
          A major disadvantage of being a subsidiary of a large organization is the limited freedom in management
          Decision making can become time consuming as issues often must go through various chains of command within
          the parent bureaucracy before any action can be taken.
          Legal paperwork involved with creating a subsidiary can be lengthy and expensive
          Control also becomes an issue when a subsidiary is partially owned by another outside organization.

          A holding company usually collects the dividends (profits after tax) of the subsidiary company as free from tax as
          possible and does not tax pure participation profits.
          
          In addition, further distributions from the holding companies usually only have a lower tax levied on them or, in
          other and best case scenarios, they are full tax exempted – no tax on dividends being paid to the shareholders of
          the holding company or umbrella company.
          In addition, Holding companies can substantially reduce the taxable profit of the subsidiary companies, by
          invoicing the subsidiaries in respect of their activities, same also applying in the case of holding companies
          holding industrial property.
          
          Holding Company in the European Union
          In case the subsidiary companies are located within the European Union, then, and also as a standard rule, a
          Cypriot, Dutch, Luxembourg, Spanish or UK Holding company will be suitable due to the EU parent-subsidiary
          directives – tax-free collection of dividends, provided that the preconditions of the parent-subsidiary directive are
          met, with respect to the value of the stake and the period for which it is held.
          Cyprus and Netherlands, in particular, have a so-called holding privilege, which means there will be no taxation of
          proceeds purely from holdings.
          Cyprus offers further benefits in this connection, considering it will be tax exempted at source in the event of
          further distributions to non-Cypriot owners, and even under non-DTA circumstances, active income is taxed at a
          rate of only 12.5%.
          
          Other Countries
          Where to Register a Holding Company
          Other countries such as Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), certain offshore countries or Singapore
          may also be suitable as the location for a holding company.</p>

          <p>What is a Limited Company?
              A limited company is a legal business structure that is a limited company is a completely separate individual from
              its owners, because it is responsible for its own actions, finances and liabilities.
              Why would you want a Limited Company?
              Limited companies have the unique advantage of allowing business owners to benefit from company profits
              without personal liability. The financial liability of company owners is limited to the value of their shares or
              financial guarantees, which means they are only required to cover business debts up to the amount they invest or
              agree to pay if the company runs into financial difficulty. This type of protection is known as limited liability.
              One of the most important obligations of a limited company is the disclosure of corporate and financial
              information. This is achieved by adhering to a number of annual filing requirements and event-driven obligations,
              including: the submission of confirmation statements, filing tax returns and annual accounts and reporting any
              significant changes in the business. All of this information is placed on public record depending on the country.
              Any type and size of business can operate as a limited company, and there are many financial and professional
              benefits to be gained - limited personal liability, tax-saving opportunities, enhanced professional status and
              investment opportunities are the main advantages of limited company formation.
              Different types of limited companies:
               Private Limited by Shares (LTD)
              
               Private Limited by Guarantee (LTD)
               Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)
               Public Limited Company (PLC)

          <p>Trusts
              Register Trust
              A Trust is one of the most flexible existing financial mechanisms, able to handle almost any purpose. Its concept
              is based on the separation of legal ownership of the Trust assets (which rests with the Trustees) from the
              beneficial ownership (which rests with the beneficiaries). It has been specially designed to achieve the best asset
              protection.
              A Trust is a legal device that allows title to – and possession of – property (asset) to be held, used and/or
              managed by one person, the trustee, for the benefit of another different person or group, the beneficiaries.
              These are a few other examples of its possibilities: it can avoid probate and inheritance taxes, invest in all kinds
              of securities, real estate, cash, futures, bonds, stocks, hold title of any real or personal property, business
              interests, insurance policies, home, boat, car, pay support in marriage, to elderly, children, medical or educational
              expenses… etc.
              
              Examples for Using a Trust
              – It can avoid probate and inheritance taxes;
              – Invest in all kinds of securities, real estate, cash, futures, bonds, stocks;
              – Hold title of any real or personal property, business interests, insurance policies, home, boat, car;
              – Pay support in marriage, to elderly, children, medical or educational expenses… etc.
              
              Most Frequent Uses of an Offshore Trust
              – To offer flexibility in the distribution of the client’s assets following his or her death;
              – The Trust will avoid lengthy and complicated probate court procedures as well as inheritance taxes;
              – A trust, specially if operative for several years is less probably to be legally challenged than a will, specially
              regarding the charge of mental incompetence so often used against will written late in life;
              – To keep confidential the beneficial ownership of property or share stock (assets);
              – To hold property (asset) for those who cannot hold it for themselves, e.g. minors or bankrupts, or simply for
              those who wish 100% anonymity degree;
              – To minimize taxation by means of the client divesting himself of income or assets in favour of the Trustee, who
              may be located in low or no tax jurisdictions;
              – To protect property and other assets from legal and political actions that may be taken against the client by
              transferring legal ownership to the Trustees (Asset Protection).
              In these privacy aware jurisdictions, there is no requirement to register the Trust with the government, and the
              terms of the Trust agreement and the Beneficiaries are protected against disclosure, they are not available in
              public records either.
              The Trustees aren’t allowed to disclose information about the Trust unless a local court order requires it. But in
              this can, you can appoint your own IBC as the Trustee, thus full controlling this feature.
              
              Elements of a Trust
              In general, a trust involves:
              A Settlor or Grantor – The person, company or other entity placing property into a trust.
              A Trustee – The individual, company, another trust or other entity who receives the property to be managed for
              the benefit of those individuals, companies, trusts, or other entities named as Beneficiaries.
              The Beneficiary or Beneficiaries – The individual, individuals, company or companies, trust or trusts or other
              entities named to benefit from the trust property.
              A Protector – An independent third party or corporate entity given the authority to perform certain duties with
              regard to a trust to insure that the wishes of the settlor are fulfilled. The trust protector can be given a limited or
              expanded list of powers, but be aware that the more powers the trust protector is given, the closer the protector
              comes to acting in a fiduciary capacity and, therefore, being subject to a fiduciary duty. At a minimum, trust
              protectors should be given the power to remove and replace trustees. In addition, trust protectors can be given
              the power to settle disputes among co-trustees or between trustees and beneficiaries; change the trust provisions
              due to unanticipated circumstances, such as changes in economic circumstances or changes in tax laws;
              terminate the trust; modify the powers given to the trustee; change the situs of the trust; and correct ambiguities
              or errors made when the trust was drafted. Under the laws of some states, the trust protector will be able to
              exercise these powers without the need for court approval, which will minimize the costs incurred in administering
              the trust.
              The Trust Document – The Deed or Declaration of Trust – Is the written instrument which details the duties of the
              Trustee, Names the Beneficiaries and Lists the Property in the Trust Corpus or body of assets.
              
              Privacy of Settlor
              The main advantage of non public registration is that privacy of the Settlor, so the Trust’s activities and the
              identity of the Beneficiaries are fully protected.
              Since the Trust is a offshore Trust, it imposes no tax of any kind on the Settlor, the Beneficiaries or in the income
              or capital gains earned by the Trust.
              Furthermore, there is no requirement for the Trustee to file Trust accounts with the local tax authority thus further
              preserving the confidentiality of the Trust’s activities.
              Depending upon the residence for tax purposes of the Settlor and the Beneficiaries, it is often possible to make
              distributions of capital or income from the Trust completely free of tax. In this matter, many reporting
              requirements are either eliminated or vested in the Trustees.
              Our Trusts are specially designed Trusts that can effectively protect the Settlor’s assets from attack by erstwhile
              creditors, thereby preserving the Settlor’s assets for the enjoyment of the Settlor and his or her selected
              Beneficiaries.
              The Trustee of a Trust can be any person that is of the legal age who under the laws of respective jurisdiction of
              incorporation, has the capacity to own and transfer property can be a Trustee.
              
              Documents of a Trust
              The documents that are apart of the Trust are as follows;
              One US Dollar to start the Trust
              
              Trust Deed
              Deed of Transfer – When you transfer items to the trust or you purchase items in the name of the trust you must
              list them on a Deed of Transfer; also if you remove items from the Trust you must also list them on the Deed of
              Transfer and a copy of each must be sent to the Trustee.
              Letter of Wishes – Since there is anyone named in the Third Schedule of the Trust Deed this is used to instruct
              the Trustee as to distribution of the Trust. You may submit Letters of Wishes any time you feel that it is necessary
              to make changes or submit a request.
              Minutes of Meeting appointing the General Trust Manager
              Power of Attorney to conduct the day to day of Trust
              
              The Beneficiaries’ Protection
              When incorporating a Trust, we do not include the Beneficiaries in the Trust Deed and you can state who you
              want to be the Beneficiaries at any time.
              You simply submit it in the Letter of Wishes.
              
              How to Maximize a Trust Structure
              A Trust and a Trustee Company can be structured so that the assets of the Trust are held by the Trustee
              Company which in turn has its shares issued to and owned by the Trust.
              With this type of structuring, these two entities become most beneficial for estate planning and particularly useful
              for the avoidance of inheritance taxes, income and capital gains taxes, forced heirship provisions and probate
              procedures.
              This can result in very substantial tax and non-tax related advantages which accrues during the lifetime of the
              Grantor and ultimately provides continuity for the beneficiaries of the Trust as well as a double layer of privacy
              and long-term asset protection.
              In most of these privacy aware jurisdictions as mentioned above, there is no requirement to register the Trust
              with the government, and the terms of the Trust agreement and the beneficiaries are protected against
              disclosure, they are not available in public records either. The trustees aren’t allowed to disclose information
              about the trust unless a local court order requires it.
              The main advantage of non public registration is that privacy of the Settlor, so the Trust’s activities and the
              identity of the beneficiaries are fully protected.
              Usually a Trust imposes no tax of any kind on the Settlor, the beneficiaries or in the income or capital gains
              earned by the Trust.
              Furthermore, there is no requirement for the Trustee to file Trust accounts with the local tax authority thus further
              preserving the confidentiality of the Trust’s activities.
              Depending upon the residence for tax purposes of the Settlor and the beneficiaries, it is often possible to make
              distributions of capital or income from the Trust completely free of tax. In this matter, many reporting
              requirements are either eliminated or vested in the trustees. Our Trusts are specifically designed Trusts that can
              effectively protect the Settlor’s assets from attack by erstwhile creditors, thereby preserving the Settlor’s assets
              for the enjoyment of the Settlor and his or her selected beneficiaries.
              Which Assets Can Be Held by an Offshore Trust?
              
              Shares and stocks in both quoted and unquoted companies;
              Investment portfolios;
              Real and intellectual property;
              Bank deposits;
              Life assurance policies issued on the life of the Settlor;
              Most other types of asset;
              
              The Advantages of an Offshore Trust
              Private relationship, for example, in Belize offshore trust deeds are not publicly registered;
              Wealth protection;
              Tailored to specific family requirements;
              Recognized in all common law jurisdictions;
              Increasing recognition in important civil law jurisdictions;
              An important tool in international income, capital gains and estate tax planning;
              Used by corporations for employee benefit plans, retirement and stock option schemes, insurance plans and
              special financing arrangements:
              
              Important remark:
              We do not include the beneficiaries in the Trust Deed for confidentiality matters; you will appoint them at any time

          <p>Foundation Overview

              Private Family Foundations
              In recent years, several private foundations have gained prominence in the media, and raised public
              awareness of their causes. Foundations are often created with one philanthropic goal in mind.
              However, as the grantors often realize, establishing your own foundation can often make smart
              money sense, as well.
              Plus, your last name does not have to be Rockefeller or Getty to start your own.
              
              The Role of the Foundation
              A Private Family Foundation (PFF) is a separate entity, privately funded by you. It is created with the
              specific purpose of contributing to various charitable causes.
              
              As a distinct, legal entity, The Private Family Foundation:
              Contributes to a charitable cause and takes a tax deduction, while relinquishing personal control over
              your gift;
              Minimizes your estate tax liability;
              Avoids capital gains tax on the sale of appreciated property contributed to the charity of your choice;
              Provides continuing employment and activity for your family members;
              Identifies and preserves your family name for years to come;
              
              Create and Control Your PFF
              Any Private Family Foundation must be created with a charitable “intent.” The Foundation is managed
              by a trustee or executive director that oversees the Foundation’s investments and distributes the
              Foundation’s assets.
              You can even appoint yourself as the trustee of your own Foundation. This way, you maintain control
              over the assets contained in the Foundation. Instead of making a one-time gift to a public charity (and
              losing control of that gift), you can monitor your favourite charities. If one non-profit changes its focus,
              or if a more meaningful cause comes along, you can reallocate your Foundation’s support.
              Foundations may be established for the benefit of a person or persons, a family, or a specific social
              purpose.
              
              Uses and Advantages of Private Foundations
              In general, Private Foundations are used by people who wish to control and maintain ownership of
              foreign corporations; however, they do not wish to own their corporations themselves directly, due to
              the Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) rules in their home countries. Several highly taxed
              countries such as the UK, Canada, USA, Australia, New Zealand, France, Italy, Spain, etc. have CFC
              rules which require that their citizens submit declarations (reports) to the appropriate tax authorities, in
              which they declare that they are the shareholders of such foreign corporations.
              Instead of holding the corporations’ shares in their personal name or in bearer form, they establish a
              Private Interest Foundation in Panama that holds or owns the shares of their foreign corporation(s),
              thus avoiding the CFC reporting rules. Hence, the advantage of using the Foundation as a
              shareholder for their corporation is to remove ownership from one’s personal name (or through a
              Bearer Share arrangement), and transfer ownership to the name of a foreign entity which does not
              have owners, rather has privately appointed beneficiaries, which are anonymous. In this way, there is
              no question as to who owns the company, since the company’s shares are issued to the Foundations’
              name.
              Another advantage of utilizing the Foundation as a shareholder applies in the following scenario: In
              many cases, when opening corporate bank accounts or investment accounts, the financial institutions
              require that you reveal the beneficial owners of the corporation. Through the Foundation ownership
              strategy, one can state that the Foundation is the owner of the corporation. Again, the objective is to
              remove ownership from their personal name, to the name of a foreign entity whose ownership is
              anonymous.
              The Private Foundation provides additional advantages other than just ownership. Some people
              donate their funds to their Panama Foundations and later use the Foundation to give educational or
              special grants to their children, grandchildren, or any one else they choose. The advantage in this
              case, is to avoid fiscal regulations surrounding donations, where some governments impose “gift
              taxes” and exhaustive reporting requirements.
              
              In general, Private Foundations may not engage in habitual profit-making commercial activities as a
              corporation can. Nevertheless, they may carry out commercial activities from time to time, as long as
              the profits of those activities are used for the objectives of the foundation. For example, a Private
              Interest Foundation may engage in banking or investment activities, such as investing in bank time
              deposits (Certificates of Deposit – CD’s), stocks, bonds, mutual funds, options, money markets, etc.
              so long as the proceeds from these investment activities are for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the
              Foundation.
              
              Elements of a Foundation
              The Foundation has a Founder, a Council, a Protector, and Beneficiaries. Below we have explained
              what role each of them plays in the Foundation:
              Founder – The Founder is the person or entity that establishes the Foundation in the Public Registry.
              Our firm is generally the Founder of each Foundation that we establish, since it is our firm that goes to
              the public registry to incorporate the Foundation. The Founder has no influence over the control of the
              Foundation, and is only recognized as the individual who presented the Foundation articles in the
              public registry when the entity was originally registered.
              Council – The Foundation’s Council serves the same purpose as the board of directors on a
              corporation. The council members are each registered in the public registry with their names,
              addresses, and identifications as council members to the Foundation. Our firm can either appoint a
              “Nominee Foundation Council” to fill the council positions, so to provide additional privacy and
              confidentiality for our clients, or the client can nominate him/herself the council. If that is the case it is
              best that the client choose non-family members, and/or others who will have no beneficial interest in
              the Foundation itself. When we appoint a nominee council, we provide our client with pre-signed,
              undated letters of resignation from each nominee council member so that our client can replace the
              council at any time. The nominee council has no control over the Foundation or any of its’ assets, they
              are only there to fill in the blanks in the public registry. However, and to provide you more comfort,
              although a bit more expensive, and as referred above, we would suggest the incorporation of a
              separate Management Services IBC, owned by you, for this charge.
              Protector – The Protector is the person or entity who ultimately Controls the Foundation and all assets
              held within it. The Protector is appointed by the Foundation Council when the Foundation is created,
              however, once the Protector is empowered, the Protector can then remove the council members at
              any time without consent of any one else. The Protector can be appointed privately, through a Private
              Protectorate Document, signed by the Foundation Council. Hence, the Protector can maintain this
              position free of public knowledge.
              We can appoint our client or some other trusted family member as Protector of the Foundation,
              through a notarised Private Protectorate Document so that our client maintains complete control over
              the Foundation, in a private and anonymous manner. Once the Protector is appointed, it can always
              be changed per the Protectors wishes. However, a Protector is not required and if you prefer, you can
              choose to not use a Protector, or to use a nominee Protector.
              Beneficiaries – Unlike a corporation that issues share certificates to certify who the owners are, the
              Foundation does not have owners, rather it has Beneficiaries. The Foundations Beneficiaries are
              appointed by the Protector through either a simple, privately written Letter of Wishes, or through a
              more formal set of Foundation By-Laws (Foundation By-Laws should be written with the assistance of
              a local Attorney at the registration jurisdiction). Either way, the privacy and confidentiality of
              beneficiaries can be protected through their appointment in the Letter of Wishes, or By-Laws of the
              Foundation, since the contents of the Letter of Wishes or By-Laws may remain private and need only
              be known to interested parties. Also, a Foundation may be set up so that the Protector is the sole
              beneficiary until his or her death, at which time the foundation continues for the benefit of other
              beneficiaries. Many like to choose one or more charities as beneficiaries
              
              Letter of Wishes – The Letter of Wishes is a simple letter, written by the Protector, which specifies
              exactly how the Foundations assets should be handled or distributed upon a triggering event such as
              the death or incapacity of the Protector. The Letter of Wishes should also state whether the
              Foundation should continue existing, and have a new Protector appointed, or if the Foundation should
              be dissolved upon the death of the Protector. There is no specific format that the Letter of Wishes
              must be written, and it can be written or changed at any time after the Foundation is incorporated, per
              the Protectors wishes. The Letter of Wishes can be held privately, or can be registered publicly.
              Generally, most people prefer to maintain the Letter of Wishes privately, so that the Beneficiaries and
              Protector remain anonymous and private.
              Foundation By-Laws – The Foundation does not need to have By-Laws, since a Letter of Wishes is
              legally sufficient for expressing the Protectors’ requested testamentary instructions. However, if one
              wishes to have a more formal Foundation testamentary document, written and signed by an Attorney,
              and notarised by a notary, then one can request the assistance of an attorney to draft the
              Foundations By-Laws. The Foundations By-Laws essentially handle the same function as a Letter of
              Wishes since the By-Laws should specify exactly how the Foundations assets should be handled or
              distributed upon a triggering event such as the death or incapacity of the Protector. The By-Laws
              should also state whether the Foundation should continue existing, and have a new Protector
              appointed, or if the Foundation should be dissolved upon the specified triggering event(s). There is a
              specific format that the By-Laws must be written, yet the contents of the By-Laws can be changed at
              any time after the Foundation is incorporated, per the Protectors wishes. The By-Laws can be held
              privately, or can be registered publicly. Generally, most people prefer to maintain the By-Laws
              privately, so that the Beneficiaries and Protector remain anonymous and private.
              
              Frequent Foundation Facts
              No Reporting Requirements or Taxes;
              Anonymous Ownership and Control;
              The Protector and Beneficiaries need not be publicly registered;
              No Capital Requirements;
              
              Directors – Every Foundation must have a council (same as directors of a corporation), whose names
              and addresses are registered in the public registry. The council members can be either individuals or
              entities of any nationality and resident of any country. If the council is made up of individual persons,
              then it requires 3 council members (President, Secretary and Treasurer). If the council is an entity,
              then only one council member is required;
              Nominee Foundation Council – We offer our clients the optional service of using our “Nominee
              Council” for their Foundation(s). For purposes of confidentiality, most of our clients prefer that we
              provide nominee council members for their Foundations. When we appoint nominee council members
              for the Foundations that we establish for our clients, we always provide our clients with pre-signed,
              undated letters of resignation from the council members so that our client can replace those council
              members at any time;
              Directors or Beneficiaries Meetings – Annual general meetings of council members of the Foundation
              are not mandated or required. However, if meetings are held, they can take place anywhere in the
              world by proxy – via telephone, email or other electronic means. Any resolutions passed are valid
              regardless of whether they are signed on different dates or in different jurisdictions;
              Corporate Books – The Registered Agent is not required to keep any records for the Foundation,
              however, it is recommended that every Foundation should maintain a minute (council meeting) record
              book, which can be held anywhere in the world;
              Convenience – It is not necessary for the interested parties to be present in the jurisdiction of
              registration for the purpose of establishing a Foundation. We can handle everything for you without
              your physical presence;
              No Business License Requirement to operate internationally;
              Legal Address – When registering a new Foundation, it must have a legal physical address that is
              included in the articles of incorporation. Our firm provides a legal physical address as Resident Agent
              and Registered Office;

              Advantages of the Foundation
              The Assets placed inside a Foundation are sole and separate property and cannot be seized to
              satisfy any personal judgements or obligations of the founder or the foundation’s beneficiaries. 
              Assets inside a Foundation cannot be attached in order to satisfy any claims against the founder,
              including judgements for divorce, lawsuit and other liabilities.
              The Foundation offers the best of a trust and the best of an offshore corporation.
              While the Foundation cannot technically engage in business activities, it can own the shares of a
              company engaged in business activities.  It is also permissible for the foundation to engage in any
              activity, which will increase the value of assets.  This means that a Foundation can be the owner of
              bank accounts, securities brokerage accounts and real estate holdings.
              Since there are no shares of ownership in a Foundation, the founder does not own the Foundation
              and as such gains important tax reporting and protection benefits with this.
              In reality, there are quite a number of practical uses and strategies for the use of a Foundation.  As an
              asset protection vehicle, there is probably no better entity in any jurisdiction at the present time for this
              purpose.
